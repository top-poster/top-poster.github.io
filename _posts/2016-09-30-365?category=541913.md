### Responsive Web

Reactive web design is the creation of a website that works properly on every device on a mobile or desktop and every screen size large and small.

Reactive web design focuses on providing an intuitive and satisfying experience for everyone, and brings the same benefits to both desktop and phone users.

The reactive web design response web design term was coined by Ethan Marcotte.

Food Sense is a beautiful website that responds to all different viewport sizes.

Whether large or small, the website is adjusted to create a natural user experience.

Please refer to this Food Sense Web.

### Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile

`Responsive` and `adaptive` web designs are closely related and often used in the same sense.

Reactive means generally responding quickly and actively to any change, while adaptive means changing easily for new purposes or situations (such as changes).

In a reactive design, a website becomes continuous and fluid with factors such as viewport width, but an adaptive website is built to meet predetermined factors.

The combination of the two is ideal and provides a complete formula for functional websites.

What terms are used doesn`t make a particularly big difference.

`Mobile` usually means creating a separate website for a new domain for mobile users only.

Mobile websites can be extremely light, but rely on new code bases and browser sniping.

This could be an obstacle for both developers and users.

(Browser sniffing : determining what a user`s browser is like)

The most popular technology today is responsive web design, which prefers designs that adapt dynamically as layout and content change depending on other browsers and device viewports.

This solution has the advantages of both reactive, adaptive and mobile.

### Relative Viewport Lengths

Several new relative length units are introduced in CSS3.

This is especially related to the size of the viewport of the browser or device, including `vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, and `vmax`.

The overall support for these new units is not great, but it is expanding, and it is certain that they will soon play a major role in creating reactive websites.

- vw : Viewports width
- vh : Viewports height
- vmin : Minimum of the viewport`s height and width
- vmax : Maximum of the viewport`s height and width

Please refer to the CSS Units above in the following link.

The variable layout does not support fixed units of measure, such as pixels or inches.

This is because the height and width of the viewport change continuously for each instrument.

Web site layouts need to adapt to these changes and fixed values are too restrictive.

Fortunately, Ethan found an easy formula to help declare the proportion of variable layouts using relative values.

The formula is to divide the target width of the element by the parent element width to obtain the relative width of the target element.

### Flexible Grid

Let`s look at how the reactive design formula works within two column layouts.

Below, the parent div of the container class surrounds the section and the aside element.

The goal is to have the same margin between the two while positioning the section to the left and the aside to the right.

Typically, the markup and style of these layouts will be similar to the following:

Fixed Grid Demo

```undefined
<div class="container">
<section>...</section>
<aside>...</aside>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
width: 660px;
}
section {
float: left;
margin: 10px;
width: 420px;
}
aside {
float: right;
margin: 10px;
width: 200px;
}
```

Flexible Grid Demo

You can use the variable grid formula to change the fixed unit of length to relative units. In the example below, we will use percentages, but the em units will work the same. Regardless of the width of the parent container, the margin and width of the section and aside will vary proportionally.

```css
.container {
max-width: 660px;
}
section {
float: left;
margin: 1.51515151%; /* 10px ÷ 660px = .01515151 */
width: 63.63636363%; /* 420px ÷ 660px = .63636363 */
}
aside {
float: right;
margin: 1.51515151%; /* 10px ÷ 660px = .01515151 */
width: 30.30303030%; /* 200px ÷ 660px = .30303030 */
}
```

Reapply to all parts of the grid with variable layout concepts and formulas to create a fully dynamic website.

As the above parent `container` did, `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, and `max-height` properties can be used to control much more in a variable layout.

However, a variable layout approach is not enough.

When the width of the browser viewport is too small, even if you resize the layout proportionally, the column size may be too small to display content effectively.

If the layout is too small or too large, the text will be difficult to read and the layout will begin to break.

In this case, media queries can help create a better experience.

### Media Queries

Media query is an extension that can provide different styles to individual browsers and device environments (e.g., viewport width or device orientation).

Being able to provide target styles independently gives a lot of opportunities and means to responsive web design.

Initializing Media Queries

There are two ways to use media queries.

To use the `@media` rule on an existing style sheet and import a new style sheet using the `@import` rule, or to link a separate style within an HTML document.

It is generally recommended to use the `@media` rule inside an existing style sheet to avoid additional HTTP requests.

```undefined
<!-- Separate CSS File -->
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" media="all and (max-width: 1024px)">
```

```css
/* @media Rule */
@media all and (max-width: 1024px) {
...
}

/* @import Rule */
@import url(styles.css) all and (max-width: 1024px) {
...
}
```

Each media query can contain media types that are followed by one or more representations.

Typical media types include `all`, `screen`, `print`, `tv`, and `braille`.

The HTML5 specification includes a new media type that also includes 3d-glasses.

If media type is not specified, media query will be based on `screen` type.

The media query expression can contain other media attributes and values and then assign true or false.

When media attributes and values are assigned true, their style is applied, and if they are false, their style is ignored.

Logical Operators in Media Queries

In media queries, logical operators allow you to create powerful expressions.

You can use three operators: `and`, `not`, and `only`.

The `and` logical operator allows the browser or device to specify a, b, c, etc. to add additional conditions.

Multiple individual media queries can be separated into commas and behave like implicit or operators.

The example below selects all media types that are 800 and 1024 pixels wide.

```css
@media all and (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
...
}
```

The `not` logical operator denies a declared query by specifying all queries except those specified.

In the example below, the expression applies to all devices that do not have a color screen.

This means that it will be applied to black and white or mono screens.

```css
@media not screen and (color) {
...
}
```

The `only` logical operator is a new operator and is not recognized as a user agent using HTML4 algorithms, so styles do not appear on devices or browsers that do not support media queries.

Select only the screen below which the expression is portrait orientation.

```css
@media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {
...
}
```

Media Features in Media Queries

Knowing media query grammar and how logical operators work is a great introduction to media query, but real-world work is accompanied by media characteristics.

Specifies which attributes are targeted within the media query expression.

Height

One of the most popular media attributes involves determining one height or width for a device or browser viewport.

You can find height and width using media characteristics of `height`, `width`, `device-height`, and `device-width`.

Each media characteristic can be prefixed with a `min` or `max` modifier, which can create characteristics such as `min-width` or `max-device-width`.

The `height` and `width` characteristics are based on the height and width of the viewport rendering area (such as a browser window), while the `device-height` and `device-width` characteristics are based on the height and width of the output device (which may be larger than the actual rendering area).

This height and width media attribute value can be any length value (relative or absolute).

```css
@media all and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 780px) {
...
}
```

In a reactive design, the most common characteristics include `min-width` and `max-width`.

These help create responsive websites that are equally responsive to desktop and mobile devices, avoiding confusion over device characteristics.

Orientation Media Feature

The `orientation` media characteristics determine whether the device is an `landscape` or `portrait` bias.

Landscape mode is when the screen is in landscape mode, portrait mode is when the screen is in portrait mode, and is widely used on mobile devices.

```css
@media all and (orientation: landscape) {
...
}
```

Aspect Ratio Media Features

The `aspect-ratio` and `device-aspect-ratio` properties specify the ratio of the `width/height` pixels in the target rendering area or the output device.

The min and max prefixes can be used. The aspect ratio value consists of two positive integers separated by /.

The first integer is the pixel width and the second integer is the pixel height.

```css
@media all and (min-device-aspect-ratio: 16/9) {
...
}
```

```css
@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.3), only screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.3) {
…
}
```

Resolution Media Feature

The `resolution` media attribute specifies the resolution of the output instrument with a pixel density known as `dots per inch (DPI). You can prefix min and max. In addition, resolution media properties can have length-based resolution values such as `dots per pixel (1.3 dppx)` and `dots per centimeter (118 dpcm).

```css
@media print and (min-resolution: 300dpi) {
...
}
```

Other Media Features

`color`, `color-index`, and `monochrome` characteristics specify output color, `grid` characteristics specify bitmap devices, and `scan` characteristics specify scanning processing of televisions, but they will be helpful when needed.

Media Queries Demo

Now try re-coding the variable layout that you created before using the media query.

One of the current problems with the demo is that aside becomes too small to be used in very small viewports.

You can add a media query for a viewport below the 420 pixel width to turn off float and change it to a layout that changes the width of section and aside.

```css
@media all and (max-width: 420px) {
section, aside {
float: none;
width: auto;
}
}
```

section and aside become too small without a media query. It`s too small to contain any real content.

When you use media queries to remove float and change width, sections and asides occupy the entire width of the viewport and provide enough space for existing content.

### Mobile First

The most popular technology with media queries is called mobile first.

The mobile first approach is to style the small viewport as the default website style and then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.

The belief behind the mobile first design is that mobile device users who typically use smaller viewports do not need to load a desktop style just to overwrite the mobile style.

Doing so is a waste of bandwidth.

It will be a valuable bandwidth for any user who expects a pleasant website.

The Mobile First approach refers to designing with the limitations of mobile users in mind. A long time ago, most of the Internet`s consumption was expected to take place on mobile devices, and it will need to be developed to properly plan it and have an essential mobile experience.

The Mobile First Media query will be as follows:

```css
/* Default styles first then media queries */
@media screen and (min-width: 400px) {...}
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {...}
@media screen and (min-width: 1000px) {...}
@media screen and (min-width: 1400px) {...}
```

You can stop downloading unnecessary media by using a media query.

In general, avoiding CSS3 shadows, gradients, transforms, animations, etc. in mobile styles is not a bad idea.

Excessive use can cause heavy loading and can quickly wear out the machine`s battery.

```css
/* Default media */
body {
background: #ddd;
}
/* Media for larger devices */
@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
body {
background-image: url("bg.png") 50% 50% no-repeat;
}
}
```

Mobile First Demo

When you add a media query to the previous example, you might want to overwrite some styles to get a better layout under 420 pixels wide.

To use the mobile style first as the default, rewrite the code and add a media query to fit a 420-pixel or higher viewport as follows:

```css
section, aside {
margin: 1.51515151%;
}
@media all and (min-width: 420px) {
.container {
max-width: 660px;
}
section {
float: left;
width: 63.63636363%;
}
aside {
float: right;
width: 30.30303030%;
}
}
```

Please note that the amount of code is the same as before.

The only exception here is that mobile devices must render only one CSS declaration.

The remaining styles that follow are loaded only from the larger viewport and do not overwrite any leading styles.

### CSS Viewport Rule

Because the `viewport` meta-tag is strongly associated with the style in which the website should be rendered, it is recommended to move to the `@` rule within CSS rather than the meta-tag in HTML.

Doing so helps you separate styles from your content and take a more semantic approach.

Currently, some browsers have already applied the `@viewport` rule, but overall support is insufficient.

The viewport meta-tag will be shown as the @viewport rule in the next CSS.

```css
@viewport {
width: device-width;
zoom: 1;
}
```

### Flexible Media

An important aspect of the last reactive web design is related to variable media.

When the viewport size starts to change, the media does not always follow suit. Media types such as images and videos need to be sized to match the viewport changes.

The quick way to adjust the media size is to give the `max-width` property a `100%` value.

That way, when the viewport becomes smaller, the size of the media will be smaller to match the width of the container.

```css
img, video, canvas {
max-width: 100%;
}
```

Flexible Media Demo

Flexible Embedded Media

Unfortunately, the `max-width` property does not work well with all media examples.

This is especially true with embedded media such as `iframe`.

When you`re with third-party websites like YouTube, you`re incredibly disappointed when you embed media using an eyeframe.

Fortunately, there is a detour.

To obtain embedded media that fully support the reactive form, the embedded element needs to be positioned absolutely within the parent element.

The width of the parent element is required to be 100% so that it can be resized based on the width of the viewport.

Also, Internet Explorer requires zero height of the parent element to operate the hasLayout mechanism.

You must then give the padding-bottom of the parent element and set the value equal to the aspect ratio of the video.

This causes the height of the parent element to be proportional to the width.

Do you remember the previous reactive design formula?

If the video`s aspect ratio is 16:9, dividing 9 by 16 would make it .5625 and padding-bottom would require 56.25%.

Padding-bottom is used and parent elements are treated as absolutely placed elements.

`Padding-top` is specially used to prevent breaking in `Internet Explorer 5.5`.

```undefined
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Fqg43ozz7A"></iframe>
</figure></notextile></div>
```

```css
figure {
height: 0;
padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 */
position: relative;
width: 100%;
}
iframe {
height: 100%;
left: 0;
position: absolute;
top: 0;
width: 100%;
}
```
